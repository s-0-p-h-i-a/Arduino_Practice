🔩 **Arduino Projects — Embedded Systems Practice**
 This repository contains small Arduino-based projects I’ve developed as part of my hands-on learning in embedded systems, signal handling, and microcontroller programming. Each project focuses on understanding fundamental hardware–software interaction, building confidence with C++-based logic, and exploring real-world embedded use cases.

---

 ### 🎯 **Goals**
 - Practice input/output handling (serial, digital, analog)  
 - Explore embedded control structures with C++  
 - Gain experience with debugging physical system behavior  
 - Develop practical skills relevant to automotive/racing tech

---

 ### 📁 **Project Structure**
 Each project lives in its own folder and includes:
 - `.ino` source file(s)  
 - README and/or dev log with notes on development process  
 - Circuit description (optional image or text)

> ### 📂 **Projects**
> | Project | Description |
> |--------|-------------|
> | `choose_LED_serial` | User chooses LED to light up via serial input. Includes input validation and LED feedback. |
> | *(Upcoming)* `choose_LED_buttons` | Use physical buttons instead of serial input to choose which LED to activate. |
> | *(Upcoming)* `hall_sensor_emulator` | Emulates a flywheel Hall effect sensor using timed pulses. Intended for testing signal processing setups. |

> ### 🧪 **Future Project Ideas**
> - `choose_LED_buttons`: Replaces serial input with physical buttons. Useful for learning debounce, pin reading, and interrupt-driven logic.  
> - `hall_sensor_emulator`: Simulate flywheel pulses for tachometer/ignition-timing testing. Practice timing precision and edge-case handling.  
> - **Basic RPM calculator**: Measure time between pulses to calculate real-time RPM.  
> - **Serial menu interface**: Practice state machines by navigating options via serial input.  
> - **CAN bus simulator/receiver** *(long-term)*: Explore automotive communication protocols.

> ### 📎 **Notes on Code & Documentation**
> - Manual raw note-taking during development  
> - AI-assisted polishing (README, dev logs)  
> - No code is written/edited by AI without full review  
> - Raw notes preserved for transparency and learning traceability
