# **Arduino Projects - Embedded Systems Practice**

This repository contains Arduino-based projects I develop in my learning trajectory embedded systems, signal handling, and microcontroller programming. Each project focuses on understanding fundamental hardware–software interaction, building confidence with C/C++-based logic, and exploring real-world embedded use cases.

---
## Goals

- Practice input/output handling (serial, digital, analog) and communications 
- Explore embedded control structures with C/C++  
- Gain experience with debugging physical system and code behaviour

---
## Project Structure

Each project lives in its own folder and includes:  
- `.ino` source file(s)  
- README and dev log with notes on development process  
- Diagrams/Demos folder with demo GIF, wiring diagram and circuit schematic

| [I/O + Data Logger](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/Analog_IO+Data_Logger) | 2 MCU system with an analog control MCU and a data logger MCU. Practice with error/data logging and UART communications. |
| [LED Basics](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/LED_Basics)                   | Arduino blinkies/Hello Worlds as first steps in learning microcontroller programming.                                    |

## Tech Stack

- Arduino Uno + basic breadboard components
- Sensor modules
- C/C++
- Geany, Make/GCC, Arduino CLI
- Arduino IDE for Serial Monitor + Plotter

---
## Learning Approach

- Start with basic functionality  
- Isolate and debug input/output behaviour  
- Add features incrementally  
- Document reasoning, challenges, and solutions

---
## Notes on Code & Documentation

- Manual raw note-taking during development  
- AI-assisted polishing (README, dev logs)  
- No code/text is published without full review
